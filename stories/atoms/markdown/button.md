# Button Component

`npm i @andy-wynyard/skeleton-react`

`import { Button } from '@andy-wynyard/skeleton-react'`

A very basic `button` component that will render either a normal white button with rounded corners, or a blue button if `primary` is passed to the component.

## Props

- `className` (for specific styling)
- `children` for text inside (will be uppercase)
- `primary` which is a boolean and just needs to be included

`<Button primary>Push Me</Button>`
